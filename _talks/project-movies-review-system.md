Introducing the Movie Review System, where AI meets movie magic to revolutionize how viewers experience films. This project goal is to provide an interface for spoiler-free reviews and sentiment analysis, enhancing the viewing journey. With advanced models like Voting Classifier and Bi-LSTMs powered by Keras and TensorFlow, we achieve impressive metricsâ€”a 91% accuracy, 91% precision, and 90% recall that understands and enhances the users' with the respective movies' plot from a bird's eye view.

* **Role**: Team Lead + Backend (AI/ML)

* **Vision/Goal**: To provide an interface to allow users to read spoiler-free reviews along with a touch of sentiment analysis (on reviews) for a better viewing experience

* **Solution**: Made use of the a Machine Learning model(sentiment analysis) using Voting Classifier(SVC+Logistic Regression) and Deep learning model(spoiler v/s non-spoiler) using Bi-LSTMs after thorough preprocessing and custom trained Word2Vec.

* **Results** Successfully built the said WebApp with Streamlit as front-end. Achieved an accuracy of 91 % with precision 91 % and recall 90 %.

* **Tools**: Keras, Tensorflow, Word2Vec (Word Embeddings), Bi-LSTMs, NLTK, Spacy, Streamlit, Render
