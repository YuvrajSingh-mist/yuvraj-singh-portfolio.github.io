collection: talks
excerpt: "
Our platform utilizes LLMs and a Mixture of Expert (MoE) approaches to provide precise guidance on
soil management, plant disease identification, and irrigation techniques. Built as a scalable web application with a
Next.js frontend and backend, and supported by a Redis queue and multiple worker nodes, FarmGenie ensures
robust performance. The system’s multilingual support, interactive community forum, and up-to-date knowledge
base facilitate seamless, expert-driven assistance for both new and experienced farmers.
